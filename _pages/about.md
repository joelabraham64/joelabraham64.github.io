Hi! My name is Joel Abraham, and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer who studied at Drexel University.

My primary focus is in **computer hardware**, with particular interests in **computer architecture** and **ASIC/VLSI design**. I enjoy working at low levels of system design, where performance, power efficiency, and hardware trade-offs are defined.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy cooking, playing volleyball, and hiking.

I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out, and enjoy exploring the rest of my page!
