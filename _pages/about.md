Hello there! My name is Joel and I am a 4th year student at Drexel University studying Computer and Electrical Engineering. I specialize in computer architecture and love diving into projects that explore the theory behind the construction of modern computers. I'm always eager to discover new opportunities to learn and connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out to me, and enjoy exploring the rest of my page!
