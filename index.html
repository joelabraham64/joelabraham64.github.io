My name is Joel Abraham, and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer who studied at Drexel University.</p> <p>My primary focus is in <strong>computer hardware</strong>, with particular interests in <strong>computer architecture</strong> and <strong>ASIC/VLSI design</strong>. I enjoy working at low levels of system design, where performance, power efficiency, and hardware trade-offs are defined.</p> <p>Outside of engineering, I enjoy cooking, playing volleyball, and hiking.</p> <p>I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out, and enjoy exploring the rest of my page!</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-abraham-a7281b1ba" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a><br> <a href="/assets/pdf/Joel_Abraham_2026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resume</a></p> </body></html>
