## Overview

This project implements a **simplified RISC-V–style pipelined datapath** in software, designed to model and explore the internal behavior of a processor core. The focus is on understanding how instructions move through the classic pipeline stages—**fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and writeback**—and how architectural components interact at each step.

Rather than targeting a complete or production-ready RISC-V implementation, this project emphasizes **clarity of datapath design**, control flow, and instruction execution semantics.

---

## Architecture

The design models key components of a RISC-V–inspired processor, including:

- Program counter (PC) and instruction fetch logic  
- Instruction decoding and control signal generation  
- Register file with 32 general-purpose registers  
- Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)  
- Simplified data memory interface  
- Sequential execution through pipelined-style stages  

Each stage is implemented explicitly in software to reflect how data and control signals propagate through a real processor datapath.

---

## Instruction Support

The processor supports a **subset of the RISC-V ISA**, including:
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations  
- Immediate instructions  
- Load and store operations  
- Conditional branching  

This limited instruction set allows focused experimentation with datapath behavior without the added complexity of a full ISA.

---

## Goals and Learning Outcomes

This project was developed to:
- Reinforce understanding of **CPU datapath and control design**
- Explore how pipelining improves instruction throughput conceptually
- Bridge the gap between **ISA-level execution** and **microarchitectural implementation**
- Gain hands-on experience modeling hardware behavior in software

---

## Constraints and Scope

- The implementation is a **software model**, not a synthesizable hardware core  
- Only a subset of RISC-V instructions is supported  
- Advanced features such as forwarding, hazard resolution, exceptions, and interrupts are not implemented  

These constraints keep the design approachable while still capturing the core architectural ideas.

---

## Testing and Validation

The datapath is tested using small instruction sequences to verify:
- Correct register updates  
- Proper memory access behavior  
- Accurate control flow for branches  
- Correct progression through pipeline stages  

---

## Summary

This project provides a clear and educational look into how a RISC-V–style processor operates internally. By modeling the datapath and pipeline stages explicitly, it serves as a foundation for deeper exploration into processor design, pipelining, and computer architecture.
